    <p>Reimu Hakurei (博麗　霊夢 Hakurei Reimu) is the main protagonist of the Touhou Project series<br/> 
    along with the deuteragonist, Marisa Kirisame. As the shrine maiden of the Hakurei Shrine,<br/>
    she manages the Hakurei Border of Gensokyo and exterminates troublesome youkai.</p>

    <h3>General Information</h3>
    <hr/>
    <h4>Personality</h4>
    <p>Reimu Hakurei's personality is typified by her desires, such as the desire to be wanted,<br/> 
    to have good food, and to find happiness. Her biggest internal conflict comes from balancing<br/> 
    her duties as the Hakurei shrine maiden and her own desires, though she does not seem to<br/> 
    prefer acknowledging many of her internal conflicts.
    <br/><br/>
    Her duty as the shrine maiden gives Reimu a sense of purpose and identity, however, it conflicts<br/> 
    with her desires in that it distances her from others and has her dealing with incidents and other<br/> 
    related problems on a frequent basis. Despite her duty making it seem as though she antagonizes<br/> 
    youkai, in truth, she wishes for peace between humans and youkai.
    <br/><br/>    
    Reimu is generally a joyful and airheaded person. She’s also incredibly prideful and quite arrogant<br/> 
    due to it. She’s often seen in a good mood until her routines are broken by some outside influence,<br/> 
    be it a youkai or the like. She is quick to anger, but she’s also quick to forget.</p>
    <h4>Abilities</h4>
    <p><b>Ability to float</b><br/>
    While many inhabitants of Gensokyo are capable of flying, Reimu's ability extends beyond that; <br/>
    she is someone who excels at floating through life, displaying a level of oneness with her surroundings <br/>
    that has been compared to a hermit. While she "goes with the flow" Reimu displays superhuman instincts <br/>
    and incredible luck, naturally ending up on the path of least resistance through most situations; <br/>
    conversely, when distracted or acting with impure motives she quickly loses her edge. On one <br/>
    occasion observers saw Reimu dodging an attack "like she was made of air" while Reimu herself saw <br/>
    the attack swerving to avoid her; on another Reimu unknowingly walked across a river without <br/>
    getting wet, by stepping on fish that swam beneath her feet. This also makes Reimu's techniques <br/>
    extremely hard for Marisa Kirisame to learn from, since even Reimu herself has trouble explaining <br/>
    what she's doing. The ultimate expression of this ability is Innate Dream, which allows Reimu to <br/>
    float away from reality and become impossible to attack; this was considered too powerful for use <br/>
    as a spell card until Marisa gave it a name and time limit.</p>
    <p><b>Aura manipulation</b><br/>
    It's stated in the omake.txt (おまけ.txt) of Embodiment of Scarlet Devil that Reimu can control <br/>
    the natural spirits of living things, an ability which isn't listed in any source afterwards. <br/>
    No clear instance of this ability has ever been displayed.</p>
    <p><b>Powers as the Hakurei Shrine Maiden</b><br/>
    As the Hakurei shrine maiden, Reimu can handle the Hakurei Yin-Yang Orbs, and is trained in <br/>
    youkai extermination techniques as well as standard duties like performing blessings. Reimu <br/>
    is also capable of channeling Gensokyo's gods, but she isn't well-trained enough to do so <br/>
    reliably.</p>
